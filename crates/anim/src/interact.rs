//! Clicks in a slide show: which shape a click lands on, what it starts (a triggered animation, a
//! link, the next step) and what the show remembers about each slide it has visited.
//!
//! The rules follow PowerPoint, as observed on its slide show:
//! - the topmost visible shape under the pointer decides; a shape without an action on top of one
//!   with an action blocks it (the click then counts as a click on the background);
//! - a shape with a triggered animation plays the next step of it per click, and starts over once all
//!   its steps have played; clicking it while a step plays completes the step at once;
//! - a shape with a link and a triggered animation follows the link at once. The animation's clock
//!   runs only while its slide is shown, so it goes on where it stopped when the show returns;
//! - with "advance on click" off a click never leaves the slide, but it still plays animation steps;
//! - a slide the show returns to (link or arrow keys) looks as it was left.

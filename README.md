## What works today

DeckCraft is in early development, heading for its first alpha (see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)).
Today it can:

- **Make decks**: slide masters and eleven layouts with placeholders that inherit position and
  formatting, eight original themes with colour and font schemes, sections, notes, comments,
  headers and footers, custom slide sizes.
- **Draw**: 150+ preset shapes with adjust handles, connectors that stay glued to shapes, freeform,
  curve and scribble tools, merge shapes (union, combine, fragment, intersect, subtract), gradient,
  picture and pattern fills, outlines with dashes and arrowheads, shadows, glow, soft edges and
  reflections.
- **Write**: in-place text editing with full font and paragraph formatting, bullets and numbering,
  columns, autofit, vertical text, fields and hyperlinks.
- **Add content**: pictures with crop and corrections, tables with styles, charts, SmartArt basics,
  audio and video (MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC, Ogg, Opus, WAV, AIFF; H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1).
- **Present**: transitions (including Morph), entrance/emphasis/exit and motion-path animations,
  by-paragraph builds, full-screen slide show, presenter view, pen, rehearse timings, media playback.
- **Exchange files**: open and save PowerPoint `.pptx`, export PDF (slides, notes pages, handouts
  with selectable text), PNG/JPEG and outlines. Unsaved work is kept by AutoRecover.
- **Automate**: 200+ commands with undo, all scriptable from the CLI, a JSON control channel and an
  MCP server for AI agents.

</p>

## Getting started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft
cd deckcraft
cargo run --release -p deckcraft-cli -- render --sample --all --scale 1 out/
```

On Linux, the build also needs the ALSA headers for slide-show sound: `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora,
`libasound2-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu, `alsa-lib` on Arch. Without them it stops at `alsa-sys`.

Fonts come from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts): clone it next to this repo
(`../craft-fonts`) and local builds pick it up automatically; without it DeckCraft uses your system
fonts.

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft/releases) has ready-made builds, on Linux as
an AppImage, a `.deb`, an `.rpm` and a tarball. On Gentoo, the community [::snakebyte
overlay](https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay) packages the Linux release as
`app-office/deckcraft-bin` (not maintained by the DeckCraft team):

```sh
eselect repository add snakebyte git https://github.com/switch87/snakebyte-overlay.git
emaint sync -r snakebyte
echo 'app-office/deckcraft-bin ~amd64' >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/deckcraft
emerge --ask app-office/deckcraft-bin
```

### Logs

The desktop app writes its `log` records to standard error and to `logs/deckcraft.log` in the
settings directory, beside `ui.json` and `prefs.json` (Linux `~/.config/deckcraft/logs/`, or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/deckcraft/logs/`; macOS `~/Library/Application Support/DeckCraft/logs/`; Windows
`%APPDATA%\DeckCraft\logs\`). A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so this file
is what to attach to a bug report: the crash guard's panic report, a failed crash-recovery save,
PowerPoint parts skipped on import and audio output problems land there. Each launch moves the
previous log to `deckcraft.1.log` (and that one to `deckcraft.2.log`), so the log of a run that
crashed survives the next start. The file stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | Log levels for standard error and the log file. Default: `info` for DeckCraft's own crates, `warn` for everything else. env_logger-style directives replace that, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug`, `RUST_LOG=warn,deckcraft_pptx=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*` covers every target starting with it (`deckcraft*=debug`). |

The logger is `apps/deckcraft/src/logging.rs`; the realtime audio callback does not log. The web
app logs to the browser console instead.

## Agents, CLI and MCP

Every action in DeckCraft is a command with a stable id, so people, scripts and AI agents use the
same verbs:

```sh
deckcraft-cli commands format.          # list commands
deckcraft-cli run --sample --cmd 'slide.new={"layout":"titleOnly","title":"Hello"}' --save hello.deckcraft
deckcraft-cli mcp                       # MCP server over stdio (headless)
deckcraft-cli mcp --connect 7990        # drive the running app (deckcraft --control 7990)
```

## Roadmap

DeckCraft covers about **79% of PowerPoint's features by breadth** (93% of the core ones) and is
roughly **80% of the way to a first alpha**. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the alpha checklist,
parity estimates and what's next, and [docs/parity.md](docs/parity.md) for the feature-by-feature
scorecard.

## Downloads

**Download DeckCraft** from GitHub: the [latest release](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft/releases/latest) has every build listed below, and [all releases](https://github.com/storytold/deckcraft/releases) has earlier versions and their notes. `<ver>` in the file names is the version number, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists a checksum for every file.

### Windows

| Build | Installer | Portable |
|---|---|---|
| x64 (64-bit Intel/AMD) | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x64.msi` | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x64-portable.zip` |
| arm64 (Snapdragon and other ARM PCs) | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64.msi` | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-arm64-portable.zip` |
| x86 (32-bit) | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x86.msi` | `deckcraft-<ver>-windows-x86-portable.zip` |

Installers and executables are code-signed.

**If the app doesn't open on Windows:** the desktop app initializes only DirectX 12 by default.
Letting wgpu also create an OpenGL instance can crash some graphics drivers (AMD's
`atio6axx.dll`) before the window appears, so the app would flash in Task Manager and quit.
`WGPU_BACKEND` overrides the default for troubleshooting (for example `dx12` or `vulkan`). In
PowerShell, from the folder containing the executable:

```powershell
$env:WGPU_BACKEND = "vulkan"
& .\deckcraft.exe
Remove-Item Env:WGPU_BACKEND                     # restore the default for later launches
```

An explicit `gl` override can bring the driver crash back on affected systems. The macOS, Linux
and web backend defaults are unchanged.

### macOS

| Build | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App, universal (Apple silicon + Intel) | `deckcraft-<ver>-macos-universal.dmg` | Signed and notarized |
| Command-line tool, universal | `deckcraft-cli-<ver>-macos-universal.zip` | Signed and notarized |

### Linux

| Format | x86_64 | aarch64 (ARM64) | Notes |

| Flatpak | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.flatpak` | Sandboxed; `flatpak install --user <file>` |
| Debian/Ubuntu | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.deb` | |
| Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.rpm` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.rpm` | |
| Tarball | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` | `deckcraft-<ver>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz` | Unpack anywhere |

### FreeBSD
